I. Car Taillight Blinker System 
1) Made a car taillight blinker system circuit on intel quartus.
2) Made a finite state machine to map out the different system states and transitions. Programmed circuit blocks using VHDL.
3) Used the built in Intel Quartus waveofrms functionality to simulated and test my circuit

II. 8-bit Multiplier circuit 
1) Used Intel Quartus to design an 8-bit multiplier and produce the result on an FPGAâ€™s 7-segement display. 
2) Designed and utilized decoders, multiplexers, encoders, adders, registers, and counters. 

III. Decoding ASK and FSK modulated signals 
1) Used MATLAB project to decode a Manchester encoded message sent through ASK and FSK modulated signals using fast fourier transforms and filtering.
